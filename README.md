# Class-Grade-Organizer

## C++

• Developed a system in C++ using the fstream library to create & store student entries with their grades through OOP 

• Designed the application to preform CRUD operations to a local txt file on a student’s information

• Created the user interface through various menu features to allow a user to sign up or login and select to view the
entire class list, access an individual profile using a student number, or to re-submit a student’s information
